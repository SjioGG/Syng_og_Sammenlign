Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow

Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that

If I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow

Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that

If I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life, yeah
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy, oh
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life, oh, oh
I miss you more than life

So if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
